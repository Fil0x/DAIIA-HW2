\section{Task1: Personalized Virtual Tour}

The personalized virtual tour was already implemented and explained in detail in the previous homework. 

\section{Task2: Dutch Auction}

The dutch auction protocol was implemented using a OneShotBehavior for starting the auction, and ContractNetInitiator/Responder for the main auction interaction. We implemented the artist manager - curator interaction.

After the initial start-auction message sent to every agent registered as a "potential bidder", the bidders respond and the auction is on its way.

Every round of the auction a Call for Proposal is sent out from the auctioneer. Each interested agent evaluates the current price, and responds with either a bid for that amount or with a rejected message. As soon as the auctioneer has received at least one bid a winner is selected and corresponding "win" and "loose" messages are sent.

\subsection{Running the Code}
\begin{verbatim}
java -cp "/Location/of/jade.jar" -jade.Boot \\
-gui -agents -gui -agents \\
profiler:ProfilerAgent;platform:PlatformAgent;curator:CuratorAgent
\end{verbatim}
Then use the graphical interface to add more profilers as you please, to make the auctions more interesting.

\section{Task3: Nash Equilibrium}
There were multiple potential games to consider for Nash Equilibria. The one most related to our implementation was the Artist Manager vs. Curator game of price setting. 
The two variables regarded were price and quality of the product, and the outcomes and Nash Equilibria can be found in \ref{fig:results1}. We assumed the curator disregarded the demand of the item.

		\label{fig:results1}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

We also defined a payoff matrix for the game Curator vs. Profiler. We did not regard the purchasing price of the item on the curator side, only the quality of the item and the paid price of the profiler (including no payment). The payoff matrix can be found in \ref{fig:results2}.

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{curatorvsprofiler.jpg}
		\caption{Payoff Matrix and Nash Equilibria for Curator vs. Profiler}
		\label{fig:results2}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Both payoff matrices seem flawed since the curator should care about demand when buying art and when setting price for viewing. Despite several tries we did not manage to model this appropriately.
